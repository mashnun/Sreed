This is a free desktop app to train for speed reading. Most of the pdf files of books can be used.
There are some pdf's which do not produce texts. I have to use CNN OCR libraries later to work with these files.
The book Big little lies doesn't work with this currently. But Christie-32 pdf works fine. you can use your favorite ones instead just give the path to your file in the file path box.
I made this app for personal usage. I want to train my eyes with fast word reading.
All the other apps want money for training simply I don't know why. But yap they got other progress tracking features which can be programmed later on.
I will try to develop it when I will get some extra time later.
you can make the executable file later from the actual code and you can also modify it for your usage. Just give a courtesy anywhere mentioning my name in small letters.
I am giving the courtesy for teaching me python tkinter by youtube channel to Traversy Media and John Elder from codemy.com
